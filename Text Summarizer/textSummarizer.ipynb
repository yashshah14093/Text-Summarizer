      "But it s the untold story of Hill s fraudulent business practices  tawdry sex life  and membership in a New York cult that makes him so fascinating. The past few decades have been a profitable era for all sorts of self help and business success books. Napoleon Hill blazed a trail for an entire industry. In fact  you can draw a direct line to Donald Trump s way of thinking through Norman Vincent Peale  an ardent follower of Napoleon Hill. Reverend Peale  author of the      book The Power of Positive Thinking  was Donald Trump s pastor as a child. It s just too bad that Hill spent most of his life as an utter fraud a fraud who by hook and by crook was constantly reinventing himself. After countless hours of research  I still feel like I ve captured just a mere glimpse of the complex man that was Napoleon Hill\n"
